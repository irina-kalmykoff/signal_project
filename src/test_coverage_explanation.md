## Untested Code by Package

### 1. com.cardio_generator (84% instruction coverage)
#### Specific untested methods:
- **HealthDataSimulator.main(String[])**
  - Reason: Contains `System.exit()` calls that terminate the JVM during tests
  - Impact: Testing this would kill the test process prematurely

- **Lambda expressions in scheduleTasksForPatients()**
  - Methods: `lambda$scheduleTasksForPatients$0` through `lambda$scheduleTasksForPatients$4`
  - Reason: These are closures with complex threading behavior that reference other objects
  - Challenge: Difficult to fully execute in a test environment without causing side effects

### 2. com.cardio_generator.outputs (79% instruction coverage)
#### Specific untested methods:
- **WebSocketOutputStrategy** and **TcpOutputStrategy** error handling paths
  - Reason: Network-related error conditions are difficult to reliably reproduce
  - Methods: Error paths in socket initialization and client connection handling

- **FileOutputStrategy** error handling 
  - Methods: Parts of the output method dealing with file system errors
  - Reason: Difficult to simulate certain file system conditions

### 3. com.data_management (91% instruction coverage)
#### Specific untested code:
- **FileDataReader.processFile** exception handling branches
  - Reason: Some error conditions related to file system behavior and malformed data
  - Challenge: Difficult to create certain file system states in tests

### 4. com.alerts (97% instruction coverage)
#### Specific untested branches:
- **AlertGenerator.checkECGAbnormalities** (89% branch coverage)
  - Untested branches: Edge cases in ECG abnormality detection algorithm
  - Reason: Complex statistical analysis with multiple condition paths

- **AlertGenerator.checkForAbnormalPattern** (61% branch coverage)
  - Untested branches: Specific pattern detection scenarios
  - Reason: Relies on specific data sequences that are difficult to construct

## Testing Challenges and Recommendations

### Main Challenges:
1. **System termination**: Methods containing `System.exit()` calls
2. **Concurrency**: Thread scheduling in asynchronous code
3. **External dependencies**: Network and file system operations
4. **Randomization**: Code paths affected by random number generation
5. **Complex conditionals**: Multiple nested conditions with dependencies

### Recommendations for Future Development:
1. Refactor the main method to avoid direct `System.exit()` calls
2. Extract lambda expressions into testable methods
3. Use dependency injection to allow for better mocking of external services
4. Add test hooks for controlling randomized behavior
5. Simplify complex conditionals into smaller, more testable methods
